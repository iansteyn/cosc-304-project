### COSC 304 - Introduction to Databases

- **Stream:** Development
- **Language:** Java

A simple online shopping website built with JSPs that connects to a SQL Server database. This is our lab project for COSC 304. By the end it will include labs 7, 8, 9 and 10 (each lab is a tag on GitHub so you can see what the code looked like at the time).
